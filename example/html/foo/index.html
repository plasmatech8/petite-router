<h2>Foo</h2>

<h3>JavaScript in Injected HTML example:</h3>

<p>Below is a counter.</p>

<p>It was added to the DOM when this "Foo" page was injected onto the page.</p>

<p>
  When the HTML content injected, the JavaScript is refreshed using
  <code>onInjection(callback)</code> to allow the counter to work as expected.
</p>
<br />

<div class="card" style="display: inline-block">
  <div style="font-weight: bold">Foo Counter:</div>
  <div v-scope="{ count: 0 }">
    <div>Count is {{ count }}</div>
    <button @click="count++">Increment</button>
  </div>
</div>
