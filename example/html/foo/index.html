<h2>Foo</h2>

<h3>HTML Injection - JavaScript works in the Injected HTML</h3>

<p>Below is a counter.</p>

<p>It was added to the DOM when this "Foo" page was injected onto the page.</p>

<p>
  When the HTML content injected, <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue">petite-vue</a>
  (the JavaScript library we are using for reactivity in this demo) is re-mounted using
  <code>onInjection(app.mount)</code> to allow the counter to work as expected, even though it was
  not originally present in the DOM.

<div class="card" style="display: inline-block">
  <div style="font-weight: bold">Foo Counter:</div>
  <div v-scope="{ count: 0 }">
    <div>Count is {{ count }}</div>
    <button @click="count++">Increment</button>
  </div>
</div>
